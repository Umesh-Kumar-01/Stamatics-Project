## Connecting The First Search : Stamatics Project (IITK)

As the name suggests, this project is related to Graph Data Structure. It helps to master the basics of complicated graph-related algorithms. This repository contains two folders. The first one has all the assignments, and the second one includes the implementation / Codes of concepts learned throughout the project. 

### Topics covered in this project:-
- Graph Representation in C++
- Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
- Find Connected components in a graph
- Finding Cycles in a forest (Graph)
- Finding Bridges in a graph 
- Types of Edges (Back Edge, Tree Edge, Forward Edge and Cross Edge )
- Topological Ordering
    - Kahn's Algorithm based on BFS
    - A DFS based Algorithm for finding topological Ordering 
- Strongly Connected Components 
    - Kosaraju's Algorithm
    - Tarjan's Algorithm 
    - Application : 2SAT
- Euler Path
- Disjoint Set Union
- Various Graph Algorithms using DSU
- Binary Indexed Tree / Fenwick Tree
- __ Project is continue__
