## Connecting The First Search : Stamatics Project (IITK)

As the name suggests, this project is related to Graph Data Structure. It helps to master the basics of complicated graph-related algorithms. This repository contains two folders. The first one has all the assignments, and the second one includes the implementation / Codes of concepts learned throughout the project. 


### Topics covered in this project:-
 Graph Representation in C++
- Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
- Find Connected components in a graph
- Finding Cycles in a forest (Graph)
- Finding Bridges in a graph 
- Types of Edges (Back Edge, Tree Edge, and Cross Edge )
- __ Project is continue__
